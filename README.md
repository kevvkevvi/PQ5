# OP CS RAP
In our rap, we talk about what recursion essentially does and why its good. We also talk about how Object-Oriented Programming works and why we need constructors.

Ways our song will teach 1101 concepts:
It will be quite a funny (and cringey) rap, so people will use humour to remember those concepts.
We’re teaching classes through the use of this rap, such as helping students know what the key components of them are, and how they work at a high level.
We relate concepts to real life things/people to make it more understandable.

Lyrics:

Yeah JK baby, (JK)

You be learning in intro all about recursion,
We be rapping bout it without much exertion.
It’s just bout traversing through a tree,
Just like how you would in 23&me.
Your function keeps on calling itself,
As easy as putting data into excel.
Once it hits the base case we know that it’s done,
It returns what you want and it’ll be a home run.
You may wonder why recursion gets so much respect,
Once you try it you’ll feel like an architect.
Just take a look at the Tower of Hanoi,
Ain’t it beautiful? Just like Michelle Choi.
Not only that, it’s also just simple and clean,
Just like Manny Pacquiao, lean and mean.

Schwat!

We be learning about a thing called a class
Without it you’ll fail to pass,
Two things: instance variables and methods,
In Python it won’t take a lot of effort,
Then you need to make a constructor,
Call it, boom, time to impress her!
Classes are pretty fundamental,
Without them your code is terrible!
If you’ve got things that are similar
Like lemon juice, acid and vinegar
Don’t be an a** Use a class! (x2)
