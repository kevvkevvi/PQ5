# PQ5: Musical Metacreation

# OP CS RAP
In our rap, we talk about what recursion essentially does and why its good. We also talk about how Object-Oriented Programming works and why we need constructors.

Ways our song will teach 1101 concepts:
It will be quite a funny (and cringey) rap, so people will use humour to remember those concepts.
Weâ€™re teaching classes through the use of this rap, such as helping students know what the key components of them are, and how they work at a high level.
We relate concepts to real life things/people to make it more understandable.
